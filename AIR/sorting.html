<h1><center>SORTING</center></h1>
<h2>Sorting helps to sort the records that are retrieved.
 By default, it displays the records in ascending order of primary key.
  If we need to sort it based on different columns, 
  then we need to specify it in ORDER BY clause.
   If we need to order by descending order,
 then DESC keyword has to be added after the column list.
